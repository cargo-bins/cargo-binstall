# Cargo B(inary)Install

`cargo binstall` provides a low-complexity mechanism for installing rust binaries as an alternative to building from source (via `cargo install`) or manually downloading packages. This is intended to work with existing CI artifacts and infrastructure, and with minimal overhead for package maintainers.

`binstall` works by fetching the crate information from `crates.io`, then searching the linked `repository` for matching releases and artifacts, with fallbacks to [quickinstall](https://github.com/alsuren/cargo-quickinstall) and finally `cargo install` if these are not found.
To support `binstall` maintainers must add configuration values to `Cargo.toml` to allow the tool to locate the appropriate binary package for a given version and target. See [SUPPORT.md](./SUPPORT.md) for more detail.

## Status

You probably want to **[see this page as it was when the latest version was published](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-binstall)** for accurate documentation.

## Installation

Here are the one-liners for installing pre-compiled `cargo-binstall` binary from release on Linux and macOS:

```
curl -L --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall/main/install-from-binstall-release.sh | bash
```

And the one-liner for installing a pre-compiled `cargo-binstall` binary from release on Windows (x86_64 and aarch64):

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process; iex (iwr "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall/main/install-from-binstall-release.ps1").Content
```

To get started _using_ `cargo-binstall` first install the binary (either via `cargo install cargo-binstall` or by downloading a pre-compiled [release](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall/releases)), then extract it using `tar` or `unzip` and move it into `$HOME/.cargo/bin`.
We recommend using the pre-compiled ones because we optimize those more than a standard source build does.

We also provide pre-built artifacts with debuginfo for Linux and Mac.
These artifacts are suffixed with `.full.tgz` on Linux and `.full.zip` on Mac and Windows.

To upgrade cargo-binstall, use `cargo binstall cargo-binstall`!

## Usage

Supported packages can be installed using `cargo binstall NAME` where `NAME` is the crates.io package name.

Package versions and targets may be specified using the `--version` and `--target` arguments respectively, and will be installed into `$HOME/.cargo/bin` by default. For additional options please see `cargo binstall --help`.

```
[garry] âžœ  ~ cargo binstall radio-sx128x --version 0.14.1-alpha.5
21:14:15 [INFO] Resolving package: 'radio-sx128x'
21:14:18 [INFO] This will install the following binaries:

## Unsupported crates

Nowadays, `cargo-binstall` is smart enough. All you need just passing the crate name.

```shell
cargo binstall --no-confirm --no-symlinks cargo-edit cargo-watch cargo-tarpaulin \
    watchexec-cli cargo-outdated just fnm broot stylua
```

If your favorite package fails to install, you can instead specify the `pkg-url`, `bin-dir`, and `pkg-fmt` at the command line, with values as documented in [SUPPORT.md](./SUPPORT.md).

For example:

```shell
$ cargo-binstall \
  --pkg-url="{ repo }/releases/download/{ version }/{ name }-{ version }-{ target }.{ archive-format }" \
  --pkg-fmt="txz" \
  crate_name
```

## Upgrade installed crates

The most ergonomic way to upgrade the installed crates is with [`cargo-update`](https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update). `cargo-update` automatically uses `cargo-binstall` to install the updates if `cargo-binstall` is present.

Supported crates such as `cargo-binstall` itself can also be updated with `cargo-binstall` as in the example in [Installation](#installation) above.

## Signatures

We have initial, limited [support](./SIGNING.md) for maintainers to specify a signing public key and where to find package signatures.
With this enabled, Binstall will download and verify signatures for that package.

You can use `--only-signed` to refuse to install packages if they're not signed.

If you like to live dangerously (please don't use this outside testing), you can use `--skip-signatures` to disable checking or even downloading signatures at all.

## FAQ

### Why use this?
Because `wget`-ing releases is frustrating, `cargo install` takes a not inconsequential portion of forever on constrained devices, and often putting together actual _packages_ is overkill.

### Why use the cargo manifest?
Crates already have these, and they already contain a significant portion of the required information.
Also, there's this great and woefully underused (IMO) `[package.metadata]` field.

### Is this secure?
Yes and also no?

We have [initial support](./SIGNING.md) for verifying signatures, but not a lot of the ecosystem produces signatures at the moment.
See [#1](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall/issues/1) to discuss more on this.

We always pull the metadata from crates.io over HTTPS, and verify the checksum of the crate tar.
We also enforce using HTTPS with TLS >= 1.2 for the actual download of the package files.

Compared to something like a `curl ... | sh` script, we're not running arbitrary code, but of course the crate you're downloading a package for might itself be malicious!

### What do the error codes mean?
You can find a full description of errors including exit codes here: <https://docs.rs/binstalk/latest/binstalk/errors/enum.BinstallError.html>

### Can I use it in CI?
Yes! We have two options, both for GitHub Actions:

1. For full featured use, we recommend the excellent [taiki-e/install-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-development-tools), which has explicit support for selected tools and uses `cargo-binstall` for everything else.
2. We provide a first-party, minimal action that _only_ installs the tool:
```yml
  - uses: cargo-bins/cargo-binstall@main
```

### Are debug symbols available?
Yes!
Extra pre-built packages with a `.full` suffix are available and contain split debuginfo, documentation files, and extra binaries like the `detect-wasi` utility.
